## [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/terms-of-use)
Usage 
Images generated on favicon.io may be used in personal or commercial projects.

Attribution 
You do not need to give attribution to favicon.io when using the generated favicon on your website. However, you may need to give attribution to a font creator from Google Fonts or to Twemoji.

## [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/license/free)
Icons — CC BY 4.0 License
In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.

Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License
In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.

Code — MIT License
In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

Attribution
Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these files normally.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to learn about Font Awesome.
